 * A long-lived shell process scoped to a stack instance, started during

 * The child process runs inside the dev sidecar so it survives

 *
 * @resource
 *
 * @section Basic Usage
 * Pass a shell command that starts a long-lived dev server. Alchemy
 * runs it in the background and extracts the first URL it prints.
 *
 * @example Start a Vite dev server
 * ```typescript
 * const dev = yield* DevServer("Frontend", {
 *   command: "npm run dev",
 * });
 * console.log(dev.url); // e.g. "http://localhost:5173"
 * ```
 *
 * @section Working Directory
 * Use `cwd` to run the command in a subdirectory — useful in
 * monorepos where each package has its own dev server.
 *
 * @example Monorepo package
 * ```typescript
 * const dev = yield* DevServer("Web", {
 *   command: "npm run dev",
 *   cwd: "apps/web",
 * });
 * ```
 *
 * @section Environment Variables
 * Extra environment variables are merged on top of `process.env`.
 * Sensitive values can be wrapped in `Redacted` to keep them out
 * of logs and state files.
 *
 * @example Custom port and env
 * ```typescript
 * const dev = yield* DevServer("Api", {
 *   command: "npm run dev",
 *   env: {
 *     PORT: "4000",
 *     DATABASE_URL: Redacted.make("postgres://..."),
 *   },
 * });
 * ```
