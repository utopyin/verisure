 * Membership of a single account member in a Cloudflare IAM user group.

 * This is an existence-only resource: it has no mutable aspects beyond its
 * identity (user group + member), so changing either property triggers a
 * replacement. Cloudflare's member-add API is idempotent — adding a member
 * who is already in the group succeeds — so reconcile is a simple
 * observe-then-ensure flow.
 *
 * Account-scoped IAM (user groups and their members) is an Enterprise
 * feature.
