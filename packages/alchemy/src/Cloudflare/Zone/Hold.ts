/**
 * A Cloudflare zone hold (`/zones/{zone_id}/hold`) — prevents the zone's
 * hostname (and optionally its subdomains) from being added to another
 * Cloudflare account while the hold is active.
 *
 * Zone holds are only available on **Enterprise** zones. On other plans
 * every create/patch fails with Cloudflare code 1005, surfaced as the typed
 * `ZoneHoldsRequireEnterprise` error.
 *
 * Destroying the resource removes the hold. The delete is idempotent —
 * removing a hold that is already gone (or whose zone was deleted
 * out-of-band) succeeds.
 *
 * @section Holding a zone
 * @example Place a hold on a zone
 * ```typescript
 * const hold = yield* Cloudflare.ZoneHold("MyHold", {
 *   zoneId: zone.zoneId,
 * });
 * ```
 *
 * @example Hold the zone and all of its subdomains
 * ```typescript
 * yield* Cloudflare.ZoneHold("MyHold", {
 *   zoneId: zone.zoneId,
 *   includeSubdomains: true,
 * });
 * ```
 *
 * @section Adopting an existing hold
 * @example Take over a hold that was placed outside Alchemy
 * ```typescript
 * import { adopt } from "alchemy/AdoptPolicy";
 * // A hold carries no ownership markers, so the engine refuses to take
 * // over a pre-existing hold unless you opt in with `adopt(true)`.
 * const hold = yield* Cloudflare.ZoneHold("MyHold", {
 *   zoneId: zone.zoneId,
 * }).pipe(adopt(true));
 * ```
 *
 * @see https://developers.cloudflare.com/fundamentals/account/account-security/zone-holds/
