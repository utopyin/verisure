/**
 * The Cache Reserve setting of a Cloudflare zone
 * (`/zones/{zone_id}/cache/cache_reserve`).
 *
 * Cache Reserve is a large, persistent data store backed by R2 that serves
 * as the ultimate upper-tier cache, dramatically reducing origin egress for
 * cacheable content. The setting is a zone **singleton** — it always exists
 * on entitled zones (default `off`), so this resource never creates or
 * deletes anything physical. Reconcile patches the setting when the
 * observed value differs from the desired one; destroy restores the value
 * the setting had before Alchemy first managed it (captured as
 * `initialValue`).
 *
 * **Entitlement-gated**: Cache Reserve is a usage-billed add-on that must
 * be purchased/enabled on the account. On zones without the subscription
 * both reads and writes fail with the typed `SettingUnavailableForPlan`
 * error ("this zone setting is not available for your plan type").
 *
 * Disabling Cache Reserve does not purge data already in reserve — set
 * `clearOnDelete: true` to run the asynchronous Cache Reserve Clear
 * operation on destroy (the provider polls until the clear completes).
 *
 * Only one `CacheReserve` resource per zone makes sense — two instances
 * managing the same zone would fight over the singleton.
 *
 * @section Managing Cache Reserve
 * @example Enable Cache Reserve on a zone
 * ```typescript
 * const zone = yield* Cloudflare.Zone("Site", { name: "example.com" });
 *
 * yield* Cloudflare.CacheReserve("Reserve", {
 *   zoneId: zone.zoneId,
 * });
 * ```
 *
 * @example Clear stored data when the resource is destroyed
 * ```typescript
 * yield* Cloudflare.CacheReserve("Reserve", {
 *   zoneId: zone.zoneId,
 *   clearOnDelete: true,
 * });
 * ```
