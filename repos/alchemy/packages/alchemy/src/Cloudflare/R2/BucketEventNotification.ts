/**
 * Event notifications for a Cloudflare R2 bucket, delivered to a Queue.
 *
 * When objects in the bucket are created, deleted, or copied, R2 publishes
 * an event message to the configured Queue. One configuration exists per
 * (bucket, queue) pair and holds a list of rules; consume the messages with
 * a Queue consumer Worker.
 *
 * The configuration's identity is the (bucket, queue) pair — changing
 * either triggers a replacement, while rule changes are applied in place
 * (the provider converges the pair's configuration to exactly the
 * declared rule set).
 *
 * @section Notifying a Queue
 * @example Notify on every upload and delete
 * ```typescript
 * const bucket = yield* Cloudflare.R2Bucket("Uploads");
 * const queue = yield* Cloudflare.Queue("UploadEvents");
 *
 * yield* Cloudflare.R2BucketEventNotification("UploadNotifications", {
 *   bucketName: bucket.bucketName,
 *   queueId: queue.queueId,
 *   rules: [
 *     {
 *       actions: ["PutObject", "CompleteMultipartUpload", "DeleteObject"],
 *     },
 *   ],
 * });
 * ```
 *
 * @example Scope notifications to a key prefix and suffix
 * ```typescript
 * yield* Cloudflare.R2BucketEventNotification("ImageNotifications", {
 *   bucketName: bucket.bucketName,
 *   queueId: queue.queueId,
 *   rules: [
 *     {
 *       actions: ["PutObject"],
 *       prefix: "images/",
 *       suffix: ".png",
 *       description: "new PNG images",
 *     },
 *   ],
 * });
 * ```
 *
 * @section Multiple rules
 * @example Separate rules per key range
 * ```typescript
 * // Rules must cover non-overlapping key ranges — Cloudflare rejects
 * // overlapping prefixes/suffixes even when the actions are disjoint.
 * yield* Cloudflare.R2BucketEventNotification("Notifications", {
 *   bucketName: bucket.bucketName,
 *   queueId: queue.queueId,
 *   rules: [
 *     { actions: ["PutObject"], prefix: "incoming/" },
