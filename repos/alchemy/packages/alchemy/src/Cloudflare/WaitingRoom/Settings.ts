/**
 * Zone-wide Cloudflare Waiting Room settings

 *
 * The settings object is a zone singleton — it always exists with
 * Cloudflare defaults, so this resource never creates or deletes anything
 * physical. Reconcile PUTs the settings when the observed value differs
 * from the desired one; destroy restores the value the zone had before
 * Alchemy first managed it.
 *
 * Writes are plan-gated: on zones without a Waiting Rooms entitlement
 * (Business/Enterprise) every PUT fails with the typed `ZoneNotEntitled`
 * error (Cloudflare code 1034). Reads work on every plan, and a no-op
 * reconcile (desired equals observed) skips the API call entirely.
 *
 * @section Managing settings
 * @example Let search engine crawlers bypass waiting rooms
 * ```typescript
 * yield* Cloudflare.WaitingRoomSettings("CrawlerBypass", {
 *   zoneId: zone.zoneId,
 *   searchEngineCrawlerBypass: true,
 * });
 * ```
 *
 * @example Pin the settings to their defaults
 * ```typescript
 * yield* Cloudflare.WaitingRoomSettings("Defaults", {
 *   zoneId: zone.zoneId,
 *   searchEngineCrawlerBypass: false,
 * });
 * ```
