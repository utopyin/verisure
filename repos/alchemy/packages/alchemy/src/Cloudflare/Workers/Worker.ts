/**
 * A Cloudflare Worker host with deploy-time binding support and runtime export
 * collection.
 *
 * A Worker follows a two-phase pattern. The outer `Effect.gen` runs at
 * deploy time to bind resources (KV, R2, Durable Objects, etc.). It returns
 * an object whose properties are the Worker's runtime handlers — `fetch` for
 * HTTP requests and any additional RPC methods.
 *
 * ```typescript
 * Effect.gen(function* () {
 *   // Phase 1: bind resources (runs at deploy time)
 *   const kv = yield* Cloudflare.KV.ReadWriteNamespace(MyKV);
 *
 *   return {
 *     // Phase 2: runtime handlers (runs on each request)
 *     fetch: Effect.gen(function* () {
 *       const value = yield* kv.get("key");
 *       return HttpServerResponse.text(value ?? "not found");
 *     }),
 *   };
 * })
 * ```
 *
 * There are three ways to define a Worker, from simplest to most
 * flexible. See the {@link https://alchemy.run/concepts/platform | Platform concept}
 * page for the full explanation.
 *
 * - **Async** — plain `async fetch` handler, no Effect runtime in the bundle.
 * - **Effect** — Effect implementation passed directly, single file.
 * - **Layer** — class and `.make()` in a single file; Rolldown tree-shakes `.make()` from consumers.
 * @resource
 * @product Workers
 * @category Workers & Compute
 * @section Async Workers
 * You don't have to use Effect for your runtime code. If you create
 * a Worker resource with `main` pointing at a file but provide no
 * `Effect.gen` implementation, Alchemy bundles and deploys that file
 * as-is. Your handler is a plain `async fetch` — no Effect runtime
 * is included in the bundle.
 *
 * Use the `env` prop to declare which resources, `Config` values,
 * and literal env vars are available at runtime, and
 * `Cloudflare.InferEnv` to extract a fully typed `env` object from
 * them.
 *
 * See the {@link https://alchemy.run/guides/async-worker | Async Workers Guide}
 * for a comprehensive walkthrough of all binding types (R2, D1,
 * Durable Objects, Assets, and more).
 *
 * @example Defining an async Worker in your stack
 * ```typescript
 * // alchemy.run.ts
 * const db = yield* Cloudflare.D1.Database("DB");
 * const bucket = yield* Cloudflare.R2.Bucket("Bucket");
 *
 * export type WorkerEnv = Cloudflare.InferEnv<typeof Worker>;
 *
 * export const Worker = Cloudflare.Worker("Worker", {
 *   main: "./src/worker.ts",
 *   env: { db, bucket },
 * });
 * ```
 *
 * @example Writing the async handler
 * ```typescript
 * // src/worker.ts
 * import type { WorkerEnv } from "../alchemy.run.ts";
 *
 * export default {
 *   async fetch(request: Request, env: WorkerEnv) {
 *     if (request.method === "GET") {
 *       const object = await env.bucket.get("key");
 *       return new Response(object?.body ?? null);
 *     }
 *     return new Response("Not Found", { status: 404 });
 *   },
 * };
 * ```
 *
 * @section Effect Workers
 * Pass the Effect implementation as the third argument. This is the
 * simplest Effect-based approach — everything lives in one file.
 * Convenient for standalone Workers that don't need to be referenced
 * by other Workers.
 *
 * @example Worker Effect
 * ```typescript
 * export default class MyWorker extends Cloudflare.Worker<MyWorker>()(
 *   "MyWorker",
 *   { main: import.meta.url },
 *   Effect.gen(function* () {
 *     // init: bind resources
 *     const kv = yield* Cloudflare.KV.ReadWriteNamespace(MyKV);
 *
 *     return {
 *       // runtime: use them
 *       fetch: Effect.gen(function* () {
 *         const value = yield* kv.get("key");
 *         return HttpServerResponse.text(value ?? "not found");
 *       }),
 *     };
 *   }),
 * ) {}
 * ```
 *
 * @section Worker Layer
 * When two Workers need to reference each other (e.g. WorkerA calls
 * WorkerB and vice versa), or you simply want optimal tree-shaking,
 * define the Worker class separately from its `.make()` call. The
 * class is a lightweight identifier; `.make()` provides the runtime
 * implementation as an `export default`. Rolldown treats `.make()`
 * as pure, so any Worker that imports the class to bind it will not
 * pull in the `.make()` dependencies — the bundler tree-shakes
 * them away entirely.
 *
 * The class and `.make()` can live in the same file. This is the
 * same pattern used by `Container` and `DurableObject`,
 * and is recommended for any cross-Worker or cross-DO bindings.
 *
 * @example Worker Layer (class + .make() in one file)
 * ```typescript
 * // src/WorkerB.ts — the tag carries the name + RPC shape; props live
 * // on `.make()`.
 * export class WorkerB extends Cloudflare.Worker<
 *   WorkerB,
 *   { greet: (name: string) => Effect.Effect<string> }
 * >()("WorkerB") {}
 *
 * export default WorkerB.make(
 *   { main: import.meta.url },
 *   Effect.gen(function* () {
 *     // init: bind resources
 *     const kv = yield* Cloudflare.KV.ReadWriteNamespace(MyKV);
 *
 *     return {
 *       // runtime: use them
 *       greet: (name: string) =>
 *         Effect.gen(function* () {
 *           yield* kv.put("last-greeted", name);
 *           return `Hello ${name}`;
 *         }),
 *     };
 *   }),
 * );
 * ```
 *
 * @example Binding a Worker Layer from another Worker
 * ```typescript
 * // src/WorkerA.ts — imports WorkerB; bundler tree-shakes .make()
 * import WorkerB from "./WorkerB.ts";
 *
 * export default class WorkerA extends Cloudflare.Worker<WorkerA>()(
 *   "WorkerA",
 *   { main: import.meta.url },
 *   Effect.gen(function* () {
 *     const b = yield* Cloudflare.Workers.bindWorker(WorkerB);
 *     return {
 *       fetch: Effect.gen(function* () {
 *         return yield* b.greet("world");
 *       }),
 *     };
 *   }),
 * ) {}
 * ```
 *
 * @section Configuration
 * The props object controls compatibility flags, static assets, and
 * build options. These are evaluated at deploy time.
 *
 * @example Enabling Node.js compatibility
 * ```typescript
 * {
 *   main: import.meta.url,
 *   compatibility: {
 *     flags: ["nodejs_compat"],
 *     date: "2026-03-17",
 *   },
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * @example Serving static assets
 * ```typescript
 * {
 *   main: import.meta.url,
 *   assets: "./public",
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * @example Deploying a prebuilt Worker without bundling
 * When `main` already points at a complete, runtime-ready ESM bundle
 * produced by an external tool (e.g. OpenNext), set `bundle: false` to
 * upload it byte-for-byte. The entry's directory is walked recursively
 * and every file matching the module rules (by default `.js`, `.mjs`,
 * `.wasm`, `.txt`, `.html`, `.sql`, and `.bin`) is uploaded as an
 * additional module named by its path relative to that directory.
 * ```typescript
 * {
 *   main: "./.open-next/worker.js",
 *   bundle: false,
 *   assets: "./.open-next/assets",
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * @section Observability
 * Cloudflare Workers Observability is on by default — `logs.enabled` and
 * `logs.invocationLogs` are turned on if you don't pass an `observability`
 * prop. Pass the prop yourself to tune sampling, enable persistence, or
 * turn on the new `traces` channel (the same toggle the dashboard's
 * Observability tab writes).
 *
 * Field names match the Cloudflare API (camelCased): `headSamplingRate`,
 * `invocationLogs`, etc.
 *
 * @example Enabling logs and traces
 * ```typescript
 * {
 *   main: import.meta.url,
 *   observability: {
 *     enabled: true,
 *     headSamplingRate: 1,
 *     logs: {
 *       enabled: true,
 *       invocationLogs: true,
 *       headSamplingRate: 1,
 *       persist: true,
 *     },
 *     traces: {
 *       enabled: true,
 *       headSamplingRate: 1,
 *       persist: true,
 *     },
 *   },
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * @section R2 Bucket
 * Bind an R2 bucket in the init phase with `Cloudflare.R2.ReadWriteBucket`.
 * The returned handle exposes `get`, `put`, `delete`, and `list`
 * methods you can call in your runtime handlers.
 *
 * @example Binding and using R2
 * ```typescript
 * // init
 * const bucket = yield* Cloudflare.R2.ReadWriteBucket(MyBucket);
 *
 * return {
 *   fetch: Effect.gen(function* () {
 *     const request = yield* HttpServerRequest;
 *     const key = request.url.split("/").pop()!;
 *
 *     if (request.method === "GET") {
 *       const object = yield* bucket.get(key);
 *       return object
 *         ? HttpServerResponse.text(yield* object.text())
 *         : HttpServerResponse.empty({ status: 404 });
 *     }
 *
 *     yield* bucket.put(key, request.stream);
 *     return HttpServerResponse.empty({ status: 201 });
 *   }),
 * };
 * ```
 *
 * @section KV Namespace
 * Bind a KV namespace with `Cloudflare.KV.ReadWriteNamespace`. KV provides
 * eventually-consistent, low-latency key-value reads replicated
 * globally across Cloudflare's edge.
 *
 * @example Binding and using KV
 * ```typescript
 * // init
 * const kv = yield* Cloudflare.KV.ReadWriteNamespace(MyKV);
 *
 * return {
 *   fetch: Effect.gen(function* () {
 *     const value = yield* kv.get("my-key");
 *     return HttpServerResponse.text(value ?? "not found");
 *   }),
 * };
 * ```
 *
 * @section D1 Database
 * Bind a D1 database with `Cloudflare.D1.QueryDatabase`. D1 is a
 * serverless SQLite database — use `prepare` to build parameterized
 * queries and `all`, `first`, or `run` to execute them.
 *
 * @example Binding and querying D1
 * ```typescript
 * // init
 * const db = yield* Cloudflare.D1.QueryDatabase(MyDatabase);
 *
 * return {
 *   fetch: Effect.gen(function* () {
 *     const results = yield* db
 *       .prepare("SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = ?")
 *       .bind(userId)
 *       .all();
 *     return yield* HttpServerResponse.json(results);
 *   }),
 * };
 * ```
 *
 * @section Durable Objects
 * Yield a `DurableObject` class in the init phase to get a
 * namespace handle. Call `getByName` or `getById` to get a typed RPC
 * stub, then call its methods from your runtime handlers.
 *
 * @example Using a Durable Object
 * ```typescript
 * // init
 * const counters = yield* Counter;
 *
 * return {
 *   fetch: Effect.gen(function* () {
 *     const counter = counters.getByName("user-123");
 *     const value = yield* counter.increment();
 *     return HttpServerResponse.text(String(value));
 *   }),
 * };
 * ```
 *
 * @section Containers
 * Containers run long-lived processes alongside Durable Objects.
 * Provide `Cloudflare.Containers.layer(Sandbox, …)` on a DO's init to
 * bind, start, and monitor the container; then `yield* Sandbox`
 * resolves the **running** instance. Call its typed methods or use
 * `getTcpPort` to make HTTP requests to its exposed ports.
 *
 * @example Running a Container from a Durable Object
 * ```typescript
 * export default class Agent extends Cloudflare.DurableObject<Agent>()(
 *   "Agents",
 *   Effect.gen(function* () {
 *     const sandbox = yield* Sandbox;
 *
 *     return Effect.gen(function* () {
 *       return {
 *         exec: (cmd: string) => sandbox.exec(cmd),
 *         health: () =>
 *           Effect.gen(function* () {
 *             const { fetch } = yield* sandbox.getTcpPort(3000);
 *             const res = yield* fetch(
 *               HttpClientRequest.get("http://container/health"),
 *             );
 *             return yield* res.text;
 *           }),
 *       };
 *     });
 *   }).pipe(
 *     Effect.provide(
 *       Cloudflare.Containers.layer(Sandbox, { enableInternet: true }),
 *     ),
 *   ),
 * ) {}
 * ```
 *
 * @section Dynamic Workers
 * `WorkerLoader` lets you spin up ephemeral Workers at runtime
 * from inline JavaScript modules. This is useful for sandboxing
 * user-provided code or running untrusted scripts in isolation.
 *
 * @example Loading a dynamic Worker
 * ```typescript
 * // init
 * const loader = yield* Cloudflare.WorkerLoader("Loader");
 *
 * return {
 *   fetch: Effect.gen(function* () {
 *     const worker = yield* loader.load({
 *       compatibilityDate: "2026-01-28",
 *       mainModule: "worker.js",
 *       modules: {
 *         "worker.js": `export default {
 *           async fetch(req) { return new Response("sandboxed"); }
 *         }`,
 *       },
 *     });
 *
 *     const res = yield* worker.fetch(
 *       HttpClientRequest.get("https://worker/"),
 *     );
 *     return HttpServerResponse.fromClientResponse(res);
 *   }),
 * };
 * ```
